Important notes,"Mid-year population estimates relate to the usually resident population. They account for long-term international migrants (people who change their country of usual residence for a period of 12 months or more) but do not account for short-term migrants (people who come to or leave the country for a period of less than 12 months). This approach is consistent with the standard UN definition for population estimates which is based upon the concept of usual residence and includes people who reside, or intend to reside, in the country for at least twelve months, whatever their nationality. Data for mid-2025 is provisional and rounded to the nearest 1000; data for other years is rounded to the nearest 100. ","Mid-year population estimates relate to the usually resident population.
